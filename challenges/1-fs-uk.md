# UK Fullstack Test

## Description

Your task is to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing user details and credentials. The application should adhere to best coding practices such as SOLID principles, Clean Code and Clean Architecture. The final code project should be hosted on your GitHub account.

### Requirements

1. Create a CRUD application to add, retrieve, update, and delete users.
2. Mandatory fields for user details include:
	* First Name
	* Last Name
	* Email
	* Mobile
	* Username
	* Password
3. Technologies to be used:
	1. PHP 8+
	2. Laravel 10+
	3. Bootstrap
	4. jQuery
	5. Datatables

### What would be a good to see

* Use a container (Docker) in your dev environment;
* Use early return always as possible;
* You can use default templates (admins etc) for front-end, so don't focus on unnecessary UI development.

### Evaluation Criteria

* Main feature working properly;
* Project documentation: explanation about the code and how to run;
* Compliance with best coding practices such as SOLID and Clean Code;
* Responsive and user-friendly UI;
* Proper utilization of Datatables together with Laravel;
* Regular commits using Conventional Commits pattern together with your repository showcase.
